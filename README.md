# Wepage Final for CSC3333
- This was my final project for Netcentric Computing. I created my own database, front-end, and back-end for a book webpage. The user is able to insert, delete, view, and update books in the database. 

- This was created in CLion using a Node.js app. The site itself is hosted on Heroku. The back-end for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/erbbri/back-end-final)
